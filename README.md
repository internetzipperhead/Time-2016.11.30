# MUCHO

The first repository in my github

## Content

1. javascript
2. css3
3. vue
4. react
5. python
6. blog

There are the modules in this repository.

## Why

First: sometimes I will worry about my css is not master very well.
so, I need spend some time to review it.

Second: learning is interesting.
so, I need learn some new characters of js and new frames.

Third: learning is endless.

Stay hungry, Stay foolish.
